# free-theorems

The original code of this library was developed by Sascha Boehme as part
of his diploma thesis in 2007 at the TU Dresden.
In 2016 Thomas Rossow extended the library with support for type
constructor classes as part of his master's thesis at the University of Kiel.

The library can be found in the directory `free-theorems`, whereas `free-theorems-webui` contains the CGI-based web-UI.
